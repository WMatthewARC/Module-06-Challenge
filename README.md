#### Background
Whether financial, political, or socialâ€”data's true power rests in its ability to answer questions definitively. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter ..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?


## Part 1: WeatherPy
The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

## Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Cities closer to the 20 latitudes skew higher temperatures on avg.

Humidity can be found in many latitudes.

While the highest wind speed can be found between -60 and - 40 Latitude, Latitude alone does not seem to be an indicator of high wind speed.
